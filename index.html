          <p>
            Hello! My name is Joseph Teixeira and I am a Front-End developer who specializes
            working with ReactJS. After Graduating from Arizona State University with a degree in Computer Science,
            I have continued my study of Web Development with multiple online courses from Codecadamy and CourseRA.
            My career goals involve becoming a Full-Stack developer, which will allow me to design and create my own web applications! 
          </p>

          <p>
            I was born in Toronto, Ontario, and moved to the United States when I was 12 years old!
            I am someone who works very well in a team environment, always making sure that the group 
            is not only on track and motivated, but everyone is also smiling and enjoying the company of
            other group members.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar, cycling, rock climbing and watching sports! Being from
            Canada, it's in my national heritage to watch hockey. However, I also enjoy watching E-Sports for 
            many different games.
          </p>
